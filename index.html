            1.What are the advantages of React? 
            React is open source javascript library,used for single page web application.
            Virtual DOM and Performance Optimization.
            Scalability and Flexibility.
            Reusable Components and Code Reusability.

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            2.Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.
            the DOM represents the actual HTML structure of a web page, while the Virtual
            DOM is a lightweight copy of the DOM used by React to enhance performance 
             while updating the actual DOM

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            3.What is React Router? 
            React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation
            among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing 
            the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            4.What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle? 
            i)Initializing. This is the initial phase of the React component lifecycle. ...
            ii)Mounting. (componentDidMount(): The method invoked immediately after the component is positioned on the DOM, i.e. right after the component is rendered on the screen for the very first time)
            iii)Updating. ...(componentDidUpdate(): The method invoked immediately after the component is re-rendered after updating the states and/or properties.)
            (shouldComponentUpdate(): The method invoked before deciding whether the newly rendered props are required to be displayed on the webpage or not)
            iV)Unmounting.(The method invoked immediately before the component is removed from the DOM)

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            5.Differentiate between state and props 
            Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, 
            while state is used to manage data within a component.

            Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component,
            while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            6.What is Param and Search Params? Write one example?  
            Param->React JS useParams Hook helps to access the parameters of the current route
            to manage the dynamic routes in the URL. The react-router-dom package has
            useParams hooks that let you access and use the parameters of the current 
            route as required.

            Eg:"< Route path='/ban/:id/:name' element={< Banner/>}>< /Route>"
            let {id,name}=useParams()

            =>Searchparam->Way to pass state through the URL. They are part of the URL 
            that comes after a question mark ?, and they consist of key/value pairs separated by &

            Ex:let [param]=useSearchParams()
            "< Link to='/?price=100000&name=watch'>You want to go next page?< /Link>"

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            7.Why should we not update the state directly?  
            Updating the state of a component directly can have unintended consequences that
            can be difficult to debug. If the state is updated directly as in the example above, 
            the component will not rerender since the state is compared shallowly
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            8. What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?
            =>In HTML, event names are written in lowercase, however in React, they are written in camelCase.

            =>In HTML, we may avoid default behavior by returning false, but in React, we must call preventDefault() explicitly
        
            =>In HTML, the function is called by inserting "()" to the function name. 
            If we don't want to utilize this way, we may use addEventLisener to provide
             events and listeners, however in React, we require the method name without the "()" appended.
